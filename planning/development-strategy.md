### Interface: Footer Section

<`ABU`

As a user, I should see a black section include `container` with 3 `div`s
### `HTML`
 - There must be 1 `section` and its `class` is "footer" "bg-dark" "py-5"
 - There must be 1 `div` and its `class` is "container" "grid" "grid-3"
 - There must be a `grid`
 - Under the "container" `div`
  1. `div` for the website name and copyrights
  2. `div` for list of links (Home, Features, Docs)
  3. "social" `div` with `fa` icons for (Github, Facebook, Instagram, Twiter) 


### `CSS`
- `social` `a`
   >margin: 0 10px;

- `fa-github:hover`
   >color: #000000;

- `fa-facebook:hover`
   >color: #1773EA;

- `fa-instagram:hover`
   >color: #B32E87;

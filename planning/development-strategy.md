### Interface: Languages Section

<`ABU`

As a user, I should see a `container` with 7 `div`s
### `HTML`
 - There must be 1 `section` and its `class` is "languages"
 - There must be `h2` text and its `class` is "md" "text-center" "my-2"
 - There must be 1 `div` and its `class` is "container"
 - Under that `container`, 7 `div`. Each `div`, there must be `img` related to programming languages.


### `CSS`
- `flex'
flex-wrap: wrap;

- `card`
   >text-align: center;

   >margin: 18px 10px 40px;

   >transition: transform 0.2s ease-in;


- `card` `h4`
   >font-size: 20px;

   >margin-bottom: 10px;


- `card:hover`
   >transform: translateY(-15px);
